### **A Brief Summary of This Analysis:**
The first three sections focus on loading the data we have worked on. The fourth section presents the graphs we have built using Python, along with their respective conclusions. The final section outlines the recommended solutions the chosen company must implement to avoid potential issues.


**The objective** of this company's analysis is to identify the key ratios that determine the KPIs for each company. We aim to analyze and connect all related ratio graphs to identify any discrepancies or challenges the company may face.


This project is our inaugural analysis, designed to evaluate the performance of four companies within the commercial sector over a three-year period, from 2021 to 2023, segmented by quarters. The database used in this analysis is entirely hypothetical and does not reflect to any real-world companies. Click the **Analyzing_The_Performance_P1.ipynb** to view the analysis.


**Alternatively**, you can access the project files directly, which are located in the Data File and include all necessary documents and data which are downloadable. The guidelines are provided in the "README First.PDF" and "Conclusions.PDF" files. 


You may choose to review the project in either format.
